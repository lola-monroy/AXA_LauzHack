# Medication Reminder and Tension Monitoring App
## Overview
This application is designed to help elderly users who suffer or are vulnerable to hypertension, manage their medication easily and effectively, as well as monitor their tension. It allows users to store information about their medications, set reminders for taking pills, and verify that they have taken the correct one using photo recognition. Its purpose is to provide a simple and intuitive interface in order to make it easier for those who have a harder time with technologies, to exploit the advantadges of technologies. 
## Key Features
- **Add Medication Information**: Users can add new medications by taking a picture of the pill and entering basic information like name, dosage, and schedule.
- **Medication Reminders**: The app will notify users when it's time to take their medication.
- **Verify Medication Taken**: By taking a picture of the pill, the app will apply computer vision operations to ensure that the correct pill has been taken.
- **Secure Data Storage**: We store user data in a secure way, localy, to ensure privacy.


## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: For creating a cross-platform mobile app.
- **MATLAB** (for image processing): Scripts used for recognizing the shape of pills using basic image processing techniques like erosions and other morphological operations. Later on transformed to a python script to ease the transition from frontend to backend.
- **Python**


## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Shape Recognition**: Improve the accuracy of pill recognition.
- **Accessibility Features**: Provide audio instructions for better accessibility.
